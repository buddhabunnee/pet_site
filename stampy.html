<br>
This kitty was brought to my <a href="http://www.hsmo.org/" title="HSMO" target="new">work</a> sometime in late 2012. He was found as a stray, wandering around a local apartment complex. I had been living with Siren and Scrumba, two female cats, and it had been over a <span style="background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(0deg,rgba(112,110,255,1.00) 0%,rgba(255,0,0,1.00) 100%); background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(0deg,rgba(112,110,255,1.00) 0%,rgba(255,0,0,1.00) 100%); background-image: -o-linear-gradient(0deg,rgba(112,110,255,1.00) 0%,rgba(255,0,0,1.00) 100%); background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,rgba(112,110,255,1.00) 0%,rgba(255,0,0,1.00) 100%); color: #FFF3E3; font-size: large;">WHOLE YEAR</span> (oh noes!) since I adopted a cat. I wasn't quite sure about having 3 cats in a one bedroom apartment, fearing that might put me into crazy-cat lady territory, but I knew that I wanted a big silly male kitty. Joey, as he was known at the time, had been an active shelter cat, available on the adoption floor, for over two months before I decided he needed to come home with me.
<br>
<br>
Why? Well, I had never seen a cat in such high spirits, all the time, in the shelter environment. Every morning when I went to clean his cage, he was thrilled to see me. He constantly played with people, and passers-by, through his glass window. The thing that killed me most of all, though, was when there wasn't anyone around he could see. Nobody in front of his cage. I could see him from my desk (though he didn't know it) and he would entertain himself for hours with the silly little toys we would provide. He would be bouncing around, knocking toys everywhere, carrying them in his mouth, and just having a grand 'ol time.. all by himself. I went through with the adoption, but the weirdest thing happened the very next day: the person who originally brought him to the shelter months ago came back to adopt him! A day too late, I told him.

<br>
Once he came home, it became apparent that this cat might be suffering from some sort of identity disorder. He behaved much more like a dog, at times. He quickly gathered favorite toys and would constantly present them to us in our bed, or at our feet. When my husband or I would throw the toy, he would immediately chase it down, bring it back, and stare at us until we threw it again. We would try to test him sometimes, trying to wear him out. When he would finally tire out, he'd start panting, dog-style, at which point we would give him a break. He also took to chasing our other cats around the apartment, full-speed. He could be a real jerk sometimes! Hence, he was named Stampy after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoAiyUduyrY" title="because some people are just jerks" target="new">this Simpson's character</a>. He has mellowed out some but is still the kitty who provides the most laughs, and is by far the most vocal. He always makes his needs (or wants) known; his meow often sounds more like a bark.
